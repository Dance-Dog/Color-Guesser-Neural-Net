# Color-Guesser-Neural-Net
I made this to experiment with my first neural network (created using The Coding Train's tutorials, and modified a little). It generates a random color and passes it through the network to get what it thinks is the closest color (from an enum of values). For some reason whenever it's not sure, it guesses yellow. :P
